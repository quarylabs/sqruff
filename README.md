`sqruff` is a SQL linter and formatter written in Rust. Key features include:

- **Linting:** Advanced, customizable SQL linting capabilities to ensure query quality.
- **Formatting:** Automated, configurable formatting for SQL code consistency.
- **Speed:** Fast and efficient, with minimal overhead.
- **Portability:** Designed to be easily integrated into various development workflows like a website.

Try it out in the [playground](https://playground.quary.dev)!

## Dialects Supported

Sqruff currently supports the following SQL dialects:

- **ANSI SQL** - Standard SQL syntax - **This dialect is used by default**
- [**BigQuery**](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax)
- [**Athena**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/ddl-sql-reference.html)
- [**Clickhouse**](https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/)
- [**Databricks**](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/index.html)
- [**DuckDB**](https://duckdb.org/docs/sql/introduction)
- [**Mysql**](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql.html)
- [**Redshift**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/cm_chap_SQLCommandRef.html)
- [**Snowflake**](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference.html)
- [**SparkSql**](https://spark.apache.org/sql/)
- [**SQLite**](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html)
- [**Trino**](https://trino.io/docs/current/sql.html)

While those above are the supported dialects, we are working on adding support for more dialects in the future.

## Getting Started

### Try it in your browser

Open the [playground](https://playground.quary.dev) to try out the linter and formatter online.

### Installation

#### macOS

You can use [brew](https://brew.sh/) to install sqruff easily on macOS.

```bash
brew install sqruff
```

#### Linux

Using `bash`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarylabs/sqruff/main/install.sh | bash
```

#### Pip

You can also install sqruff using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/sqruff/).

```bash
pip install sqruff
```

#### GitHub Action

You can also use the GitHub Action to install and run sqruff in your CI/CD pipeline. Inside a Github Action, `sqruff` automatically outputs linting output in the GitHub format so that it can be easily viewed in the PR tab.

```yaml
jobs:
  sqruff-lint:
    name: Lint with sqruff
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: quarylabs/install-sqruff-cli-action@main
      - run: sqruff lint .
```

#### For other platforms

Either download the binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/quarylabs/sqruff/releases) or compile it yourself and with cargo with the following commands.

```bash
rustup toolchain install nightly
cargo +nightly install sqruff
sqruff --help
```

#### Visual Studio Code Extension

In addition to the CLI installation mechanism listed above, sqruff is also released as a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Quary.sqruff).

### Usage

#### Linting

To lint a SQL file or set of files, run the following command:

```bash
sqruff lint <file>
sqruff lint <file1> <file2> <file3>
sqruff lint <directory>
```

#### Fixing

To fix a single or set of files, run the following command:

```bash
sqruff fix <file/paths/directory>
```

#### Configuration

Settings for SQL dialect, indentation, capitalization, and other linting/style options are configured in a `.sqruff` file. This file should be located in the directory where Sqruff is being run.

The following example highlights a few configuration points: setting the dialect to `sqlite`, turning on all rules except AM01 and AM02, and configuring some indentation settings. For a comprehensive list of configuration options, see the [default configuration file](crates/lib/src/core/default_config.cfg). You can also refer to the [rules documentation](docs/rules.md) for more information on configuring specific rules.

```ini
[sqruff]
dialect = sqlite
exclude_rules = AM01,AM02
rules = all

[sqruff:indentation]
indent_unit = space
tab_space_size = 4
indented_joins = True
```

#### Ignoring files

Like `.ignore` files, sqruff ignores files and folder, specified in a `.sqruffignore` file placed in the root of where the command is run. For example if placed in `.sqruffignore`, the following code will ignore `.hql` files and files in any director named temp:

```
# ignore ALL .hql files
*.hql

# ignore ALL files in ANY directory named temp
temp/
```

#### Ignoring errors

The NoQA directive is a way to disable specific rules or all rules for a specific line or range of lines. Similar to flake8’s ignore, individual lines can be ignored by adding `-- noqa` to the end of the line.

##### Ignoring single line errors

The following example will ignore all errors on the line where it is placed:

```sql
-- Ignore all errors
SeLeCt  1 from tBl ;    -- noqa

-- Ignore rule CP02 & rule CP03
SeLeCt  1 from tBl ;    -- noqa: CP02,CP03
```

##### Ignoring multiple line errors

Similar to pylint’s “pylint directive”, ranges of lines can be ignored by adding `-- noqa:disable=<rule>[,...] | all` to the line. Following this directive, specified rules (or all rules, if “all” was specified) will be ignored until a corresponding `-– noqa:enable=<rule>[,…] | all`.

For example:

```sql
-- Ignore rule AL02 from this line forward
SELECT col_a a FROM foo -- noqa: disable=AL02

-- Ignore all rules from this line forward
SELECT col_a a FROM foo -- noqa: disable=all

-- Enforce all rules from this line forward
SELECT col_a a FROM foo -- noqa: enable=all
```

#### Help

To get help on the available commands and options, run the following command:

```bash
sqruff --help
```

For all the details on the CLI commands and options, see the [CLI documentation](./docs/cli.md).
